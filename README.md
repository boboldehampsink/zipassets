=================

Plugin that downloads a zipfile with a selection of assets.

Important:
The plugin's folder should be named "zipassets"

Deprecated
=================
With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this plugin has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.

Example
=================
```html
<form method="post" target="_blank">
	{{ getCsrfInput() }}
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="zipAssets/download">
    <input type="hidden" name="filename" value="your-zipfile">

    <input type="checkbox" name="files[]" value="123"><!-- asset id -->
    <input type="checkbox" name="files[]" value="234"><!-- asset id -->

    <input type="submit" value="Download!">
</form>
```

Via url:
/actions/zipAssets/download?filename=your-zipfile&files[]=123&files[]=234

Roadmap
=================
 - Support for Asset Element Actions

Development
=================
Run this from your Craft installation to test your changes to this plugin before submitting a Pull Request
```bash
phpunit --bootstrap craft/app/tests/bootstrap.php --configuration craft/plugins/zipassets/phpunit.xml.dist --coverage-text craft/plugins/zipassets/tests
```
