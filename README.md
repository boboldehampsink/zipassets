    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="zipAssets/download">
    <input type="hidden" name="filename" value="your-zipfile">

    <input type="checkbox" name="files[]" value="123"><!-- asset id -->
    <input type="checkbox" name="files[]" value="234"><!-- asset id -->

</form>
```

/actions/zipAssets/download?filename=your-zipfile&files[]=123&files[]=234

AdminCP "Download All" button
